SkToolbox - Valheim
AUTHOR: Skrip (https://steamcommunity.com/id/Skrip037/)
Toolbox Version: 1.10.2
Valheim at time of release: 0.148.7

SkToolbox is a fully clientside utility meant for improving the gameplay experience, by enabling the player to modify their character or the environment to their liking. The mod enables features that could allow a player to drastically change their character or others.

It is recommended that you use discretion when using these commands in Multiplayer, as this will affect the gameplay experience of others.

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
BepInEx for Valheim - If you get errors in your console, remove Valheim.DisplayBepInExInfo from the plugins folder if it exists!
Unstripped UnityEngine, Core, IMGUI, InputLegacy, Physics, and UI modules.

:: FEATURES ::
• This mod works by extending the functionality of the console and chat commands. Most of the commands shown below are usable in both the console and via chat. Most commands work both via console or chat.
• The SkToolbox now allows customization of the look of the console. Changes have been made by default. See the configuration file for details.
• Please see NexusMods page for most up to date feature list.

:: HOW TO INSTALL ::
	Method 1
	• Simply use your mod manager (Vortex is recommended) to download and manage the files. Make sure your mod manager includes a working version of BepInEx.
	• Run the game and enjoy.
	Method 2
	• Simply open the zip file and extract all contents to the game's root directory (You'll see valheim.exe and UnityPlayer.dll in this folder).
After extraction, in the game root folder, you should see the Valheim.exe file, and the BepInEx folder in the same folder. (https://i.imgur.com/QKx9yxU.png)

	Method 3 (Only Updating or you have a working installation of BepInEx already installed)
	• Place the dll file in the BepInEx plugins directory.
	• Run the game and enjoy.

• I just need to update! What do I do?
	• Extract the .dll file to the plugins folder, run the game.

:: HOW TO USE ::
• Complete one of the two installation methods, then simply run the game and open the console.
	• Type help or /?
	• (/? also works as a chat command)
